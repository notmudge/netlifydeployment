# Welcome to NotMudge

I’ve spent my career in project management, process improvement, and business change —  
helping teams make complex systems work better and more efficiently.

Now, I’m moving into **data science** — combining practical, operational experience  
with analytical tools to understand and improve systems in a deeper, data-driven way.

This site is a space for experiments, learning notes, and reflections  
at the intersection of *data, engineering, and real-world problem-solving.*

## Recent Work
Here’s a live feed of my recent GitHub commits:

<div id="commit-list">Loading commits...</div>

<script>
  const GH_USER = "notmudge";
  const LIMIT = 10;

  async function loadCommits() {
    const res = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${GH_USER}/events/public`);
    if (!res.ok) return;
    const events = await res.json();

    const commits = [];
    for (const ev of events) {
      if (ev.type === "PushEvent") {
        const repo = ev.repo?.name;
        const when = ev.created_at;
        for (const c of ev.payload.commits || []) {
          commits.push({
            msg: c.message,
            url: `https://github.com/${repo}/commit/${c.sha}`,
            repo,
            when
          });
        }
      }
      if (commits.length >= LIMIT) break;
    }

    const list = document.getElementById("commit-list");
    list.innerHTML = commits.length
      ? `<ul>${commits.map(c => `
          <li>
            <a href="${c.url}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">${c.msg}</a>
            <small> — ${c.repo} • ${new Date(c.when).toLocaleDateString()}</small>
          </li>
        `).join("")}</ul>`
      : "<p>No recent public commits found.</p>";
  }

  loadCommits();
</script>
