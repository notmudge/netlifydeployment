# Hi, I'm Mudge 👋

This is my data‑science blog built with **Quarto** and deployed on **Netlify**.

- Posts are under `posts/`
- CV lives at `cv/index.qmd` (you'll protect this path on Netlify)
- You can write posts as `.qmd` or Jupyter notebooks `.ipynb`

Below is a tiny Python example with a plot:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine wave")
plt.show()
```
