# Welcome to NotMudge

I’ve spent my career in project management, process improvement, and business change —  
helping teams make complex systems work better and more efficiently.

Now, I’m moving into **data science** — combining practical, operational experience  
with analytical tools to understand and improve systems in a deeper, data-driven way.

This site is a space for experiments, learning notes, and reflections  
at the intersection of *data, engineering, and real-world problem-solving.*
